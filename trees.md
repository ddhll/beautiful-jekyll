[Melbourne Data](https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/Environment/Trees-with-species-and-dimensions-Urban-Forest-/fp38-wiyy) have made available data of approximately [70,000 trees](https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/Environment/Trees-with-species-and-dimensions-Urban-Forest-/fp38-wiyy) in the City of Melbourne. This visualization displays the location and common name of 69,114 trees. The colour of the circles indicate the year of planting (darker = older), the size of the circle indicates the diameter of the tree (where data was available).

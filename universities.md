[Times Higher Education](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2018/world-ranking#!/page/0/length/25/sort_by/rank/sort_order/asc/cols/stats) recently published their top 1,000 World University Rankings for 2018. I thought it would be neat to visualize their distribution. Indicated are the ranks and locations of the top 1,000 universities according to Times Higher Education. An institution's ratio of students to staff (colour) and their number of students (diameter) are also indicated.

Data can be found [here](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2018/world-ranking#!/page/0/length/25/sort_by/rank/sort_order/asc/cols/stats). To geocode the latitudinal and longitdudinal co-ordinates to the university names I used a [Bing geocoding tool](https://github.com/maxrice/excel-geocoding-tool) created by Max Rice. Many thanks to Max for this tool.

title: world cup predictions

In 12 hours, the 2018 FIFA World Cup will begin. Having read the 538's predictions, I decided to produce my own predictions based on an alternative version of their [SPI](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-our-club-soccer-projections-work/).

I wanted to utilise goal difference as a primary predictor and adjust the SPI based on "hype", using [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/?geo=US) to investigate the 32 countries interest in the world cup. I used STATA for the analysis, then graphed these over time in plot.ly:

| Team | Mean Interest (Hype)
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| Argentina | 24.4231
|     Belgium |        4.51923
|      Brazil |        10.5192
|    Colombia |        .528846
|  Costa Rica |        6.17308
|     Croatia |        1.02885
|     Denmark |        1.04808
|       Egypt |        12.9231
|     England |        13.2692
|      France |        6.44231
|     Germany |        8.32692
|     Iceland |        2.13462
|        Iran |        7.71154
|       Japan |        3.69231
|      Mexico |        2.50962
|     Morocco |        .846154
|     Nigeria |        8.42308
|      Panama |        3.92308
|        Peru |        4.35577
|      Poland |           .875
|    Portugal |        2.35577
|      Russia |        11.5192
|Saudi Arabia |        3.52885
|     Senegal |           5.75
|      Serbia |        .913462
| South Korea |            2.5
|       Spain |        5.78846
|      Sweden |        1.33654
| Switzerland |        .855769
|     Tunisia |        3.55769
|     Uruguay |        1.19231

The following is a scatter plot to graph Hype vs SPI, the size of the dots indicate goal difference and the colour of the dots indicate different World Cup groups.

Based on these statistics, my prediction for the winners of the 2018 World Cup is Brazil.

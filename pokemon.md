Choosing your final team in Pokemon Sword/Shield is a tough ask, so I created this 3D tool to aid in selection. I extracted this dataset from the [Ranked Boost Evolution Chart](https://rankedboost.com/pokemon-sword-shield/evolution-chart/).

On the X axis is special attack, Y axis is special defense and the Z axis is total. Total is a sum of special attack, special defense, attack, defense, HP and speed. Colour scale indicates HP (blue-green:low-high), size indicates speed (small-big:low-high).
